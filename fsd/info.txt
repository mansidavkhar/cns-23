Here is a short explanation for each of the key files and concepts in the boilerplate code.


1. Custom Hooks (/hooks)

Custom hooks are reusable functions that start with "use". They let you extract component logic into reusable pieces.

useFetch.js
What it does: Fetches data from any given URL.
How it's used: It handles all the loading, error, and data states for you.
Example: const { data, loading, error } = useFetch('https://api.example.com/data');
Used in: ProductsPage.jsx (to get the products).

useLocalStorage.js
What it does: A "useState" that remembers its value even after you refresh the page by saving the data to the browser's local storage.
How it's used: Exactly like useState, but you give it a "key" to save under.
Example: const [name, setName] = useLocalStorage('username', 'Guest');
Used in: HooksDemoPage.jsx and ProfilePage.jsx (to remember the user's name).

useWindowSize.js
What it does: Tracks the browser window's current width and height.
How it's used: It automatically updates whenever the user resizes their window. This is great for responsive designs.
Example: const { width, height } = useWindowSize();
Used in: HooksDemoPage.jsx.

useToggle.js
What it does: Manages a simple boolean (true/false) state.
How it's used: Gives you a state value and a function to easily flip it from true to false (or vice-versa).
Example: const [isOpen, toggleIsOpen] = useToggle(false);
Used in: HooksDemoPage.jsx (for the "Show/Hide" button).





2. Context APIs (/contexts)

Context provides a way to pass data deep into the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It's used for "global" state.


Each context has two parts:

The Provider (AuthProvider, CartProvider...): You wrap this around your entire app (in main.jsx). It "provides" the state to all children.
The Hook (useAuth, useCart...): You use this hook inside any component that needs to read or change that global state.

AuthContext.jsx (useAuth)
What it does: Manages the currently logged-in user.
How it's used: Provides the user object, an isAuthenticated boolean, and login() / logout() functions to any component.
Used in: Header.jsx, ProfilePage.jsx, HomePage.jsx.

CartContext.jsx (useCart)
What it does: Manages the shopping cart state (a list of products).
How it's used: Provides the cart array and functions like addItem(), removeItem(), and clearCart().
Used in: Header.jsx (to show the cart count), ProductsPage.jsx (to add items).

NotificationContext.jsx (useNotification)
What it does: Manages a simple pop-up notification message.
How it's used: Provides a showNotification() function that any component can call to make a message appear on the screen.
Used in: App.jsx (to render the Notification component), ProductsPage.jsx (to show "Item Added!"), ProfilePage.jsx (to show "Profile Saved!").


















// Your REAL App.jsx file should look like this

import React, { useState } from 'react';

// Import pages from their own files
import HomePage from './pages/HomePage';
import ProductsPage from './pages/ProductsPage';
import ProfilePage from './pages/ProfilePage';
import HooksDemoPage from './pages/HooksDemoPage';

// Import components from their own files
import Header from './components/Header';
import Notification from './components/Notification';

function App() {
  const [page, setPage] = useState('home');

  const renderPage = () => {
    switch (page) {
      case 'home':
        return <HomePage />;
      // ...etc
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-100 font-sans">
      <Header setPage={setPage} />
      <main className="container mx-auto p-4 md:p-8">
        {renderPage()}
      </main>
      <Notification />
      {/* ...footer */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
