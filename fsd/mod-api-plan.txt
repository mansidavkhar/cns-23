3-Step Plan to Adapt Boilerplate for Any API

This plan assumes you are editing the ProductsPage section (around line 484) in your App.jsx file.


Step 1: Update the API URL

Paste the new API URL (e.g., https://api.exam.com/data) from your exam into your browser to see the JSON data.

Find const API_URL = ... (line 484) and replace the old URL with the new one.



Step 2: Fix the .map() Loop (To Prevent Crashing)

Look at the JSON in your browser from Step 1.

If the JSON starts with [ (an array):
Your data is in recipeData (or whatever you named it).

Change the .map() line (around line 546) to:
{recipeData && recipeData.map((item) => (
  <RecipeCard key={item.id} recipe={item} />
))}

If the JSON starts with { (an object):
Your array is inside that object. Find its key (e.g., "recipes", "products", "results").

Change the .map() line (around line 546) to use that key:
{recipeData && recipeData.recipes && recipeData.recipes.map((recipe) => (
  <RecipeCard key={recipe.id} recipe={recipe} />
))}
(This example assumes the key is "recipes")




Step 3: Update the Card Component (To Display Data)

Go to your RecipeCard component (around line 487).

Look at the property names (keys) from the API data (e.g., "name", "image", "cuisine").

Change the component to use the new keys.

Change Image:

Find: <img src={imageUrl} ... />

Change to: <img src={recipe.image} alt={recipe.name} ... />

Change Title:

Find: <h3>{...}</h3>

Change to: <h3>{recipe.name}</h3>

Update/Add Other Data:

Change: <p>{...}</p>

To: <p>{recipe.cuisine} Cuisine</p>

Repeat Step 3 until your card shows all the required information.
